        <h2 id="home">Home</h2>
        <p>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans. It is a fully or semi sheltered <br>space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, where domestic activity <br>can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing.</p>

    <p> Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual<br> space.[1] The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales, from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual <br>dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.</p>
            
<p>The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines - topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal  <br>space, contested space to gender and politics.[2] The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological<br> advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.</p>

        <p>Electronics has hugely influenced the development of modern society. The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention  <br>of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron <br>age.[1] Practical applications started with the invention of the diode by Ambrose Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest in the early 1900s, which made the detection of small electrical voltages such as radio signals from a radio antenna possible with a non-mechanical device.

            Vacuum tubes (Thermionic valves) were the first active electronic components which controlled current flow by influencing the flow of individual electrons, <br>[2] They were responsible for the electronics revolution of the first half of the twentieth century,[3][4] They enabled the <br>construction of equipment that used current amplification and rectification to gives us radio, television, radar, long-distance telephony and much more. The early growth of electronics was rapid, and by the 1920s, commercial radio broadcasting and communications were becoming widespread and electronic amplifiers were being used in such diverse applications as long distance telephony and the music recording industry.
            
            The next big technological step took several decades to appear, when the first working point-contact transistor was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser  <br>Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947.[5] However, vacuum tubes played a leading role in the field of microwave and high power <br>transmission as well as television receivers until the middle of the 1980s.[6] Since then, solid-state devices have all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as high power RF amplifiers, cathode ray tubes, specialist audio equipment, guitar amplifiers and some microwave devices.
            
            In April 1955, the IBM 608 was the first IBM product to use transistor circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed to be the first all-transistorized calculator <br> to be manufactured for the commercial market.[7][8] The 608 contained more than 3,000 germanium transistors. Thomas J.<br> Watson Jr. ordered all future IBM products to use transistors in their design. From that time on transistors were almost exclusively used for computer logic and peripherals. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.[9]
            
            The MOSFET (MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[10][11][12][13] The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that  <br>could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.[9] Its advantages include high scalability,[14] <br>affordability,[15] low power consumption, and high density.[16] It revolutionized the electronics industry,[17][18] becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.[12][19] The MOSFET is the basic element in most modern electronic equipment.[20][21]</p>
        <h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
        <p>The many types of utilities available include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas. Other utility companies might specialize in  <br>just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean and renewable energy sources like wind turbines<br> and solar panels, to produce electricity. Investors may also purchase regional utilities or invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing baskets of utility stocks located throughout the U.S.</p>
        <h2 id="Brands">Brands</h2>
            <p>What Is a Brand?
            The term brand refers to a business and marketing concept that helps people identify a particular company, product, or individual. Brands are intangible, which means you can't  <br>actually touch or see them. As such, they help shape people's perceptions of companies, their products, or <br>individuals. Brands commonly use identifying markers to help create brand identities within the marketplace. They provide enormous value to the company or individual, giving them a competitive edge over others in the same industry. As such, many entities seek legal protection for their brands by obtaining trademarks.

        <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
        <p>Images may be two or three-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by optical devices – such as  <br>cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human <br>eye or water.

            The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, a painting or a banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered <br> manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or <br>computer graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods, especially in a pseudo-photograph.</p>
        <h2 id="gifts">Gifts</h2>
        <p>A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although <br> gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many <br>countries, the act of mutually exchanging money, goods, etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. By extension the term gift can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.</p>
